MANDELBROT GENERATOR @ v1.0  
Created by Sebastian Dichler, 2017  
  
The pixelgen program is generating a mandelbrot set and writes them into a P3 PPM picture.  
  
The whole process is running in a while loop and zooms out of the standard zoom.  
Debug messages appear read and time calculation messages appear in yellow background
